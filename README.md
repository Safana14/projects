Data Science & Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my project repository! This collection includes real-world projects demonstrating data analysis, visualization, and machine learning applications using Python. Below you'll find an overview of each project, their objectives, and how to run them.

Netflix Data Analysis

File: `Netflix_project (1).ipynb`  
Objective: 
Explore and analyze Netflix's content dataset to understand patterns in genres, ratings, and release trends using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analysis of genre distribution and content ratings
- Trends by year and content type
- Visualizations for user-friendly insights
Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
How to Run:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Make sure the dataset (CSV) is available in the same directory.
4. Run all cells to see the output.


Personalized Healthcare Recommendations

File:`Personalized_Healthcare_Recommendations.ipynb`  
Objective:
Build a machine learning model to provide personalized healthcare advice or predictions based on patient data.
Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Feature selection and splitting
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy metrics and health recommendations
Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
How to Run:
1. Ensure required libraries are installed (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, etc.).
2. Place the dataset in the same directory.
3. Open the notebook and run all cells to train and evaluate the model.
